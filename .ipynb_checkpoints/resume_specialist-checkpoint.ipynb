      "\n",
      "1. **Quantify achievements:** Wherever possible, it is helpful to include specific numbers or metrics to quantify the candidate's achievements. For example, instead of saying \"Developed machine learning models for X project,\" the candidate could say \"Developed and deployed 5 machine learning models for X project, resulting in a 20% increase in accuracy.\"\n",
      "2. **Add a professional title:** Adding a professional title at the top of the resume can help to clearly communicate the candidate's area of expertise and career goals. For example, the title \"Machine Learning Expert\" or \"Senior Research Scientist\" could be added above the candidate's name.\n",
      "3. **Customize the resume for each job application:** It is important to tailor the resume to each job application, highlighting the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job posting. The candidate could consider adding a brief \"Summary\" or \"Objective\" section at the top of the resume that is customized for each job application.\n",
      "4. **Include any relevant open-source projects:** If the candidate has contributed to any open-source projects or has published any research papers, these should be included in the resume to showcase their expertise and experience.\n",
      "5. **Proofread the resume:** The candidate should carefully proofread the resume to ensure that there are no typos or grammatical errors, which can make a negative impression on potential employers.\n",

For example, instead of saying \"Developed machine learning models for X project,\" the candidate could say \"Developed and deployed 5 machine learning models for X project, resulting in a 20% increase in accuracy.\"\n",
      "2. **Add a professional title:** Adding a professional title at the top of the resume can help to clearly communicate the candidate's area of expertise and career goals. For example, the title \"Machine Learning Expert\" or \"Senior Research Scientist\" could be added above the candidate's name.\n",
      "3. **Customize the resume for each job application:** It is important to tailor the resume to each job application, highlighting the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job posting. The candidate could consider adding a brief \"Summary\" or \"Objective\" section at the top of the resume that is customized for each job application.\n",
      "4. **Include any relevant open-source projects:** If the candidate has contributed to any open-source projects or has published any research papers, these should be included in the resume to showcase their expertise and experience.\n",
