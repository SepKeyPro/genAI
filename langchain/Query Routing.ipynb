This process ensures that each query is handled by the optimal component within a complex system, which may include multiple databases, language models, or specialized APIs. Effective query routing improves the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval by leveraging the strengths of various sources and distributing the computational load. It involves analyzing the query to understand its intent and context, then dynamically selecting the best route for processing. This could mean querying a specific knowledge base for factual answers, using a conversational model for dialogue-based queries, or accessing a specialized API for niche information. By strategically routing queries, RAG applications can provide more precise, relevant, and timely responses, enhancing the overall user experience and making the system more robust and scalable."],"metadata":{"id":"g_FW5eOjaOoe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install langchain-core langchain langchain-community langchain-openai pypdf langchainhub chromadb"],"metadata":{"id":"bhGnqvUsj9uT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720041336300,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":210,"user":{"displayName":"sepehr keykhaie","userId":"18194880490269398179"}}},"execution_count":74,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader\n","from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\n","from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n","from langchain import hub\n","from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough, RunnableLambda\n","from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings"],"metadata":{"id":"jB_Bk7rIhKac","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720041339753,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":183,"user":{"displayName":"sepehr keykhaie","userId":"18194880490269398179"}}},"execution_count":75,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Logical Routing in RAG\n","\n","In logical routing, we let the LLM (Large Language Model) choose the best route from a set of predefined options.
